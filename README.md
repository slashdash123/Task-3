# Task-3
SPI (simple weather station using TC77 temperature sensor)

IMPORTANT Some variable declarations and function names are in my native language (Slovene). Reason being is, I did these assignments in the scope of my University. Hopefully the code will make sense, as I briefly explain the purpose of each task below.

This exercise consists of the implementation of a simple weather station, where we used the SPI protocol to establish a connection with the TC77 temperature sensor, 
and print the results with the printf function.

Tools used: STM32F429I discovery board (Cortex M4), breadboard, wires, resistor, TC77 temperature sensor
